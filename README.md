Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game project! This is a simple, yet classic game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Features
Two-Player Mode: Allows two players to play the game on the same device.
Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes.
Winner Detection: Detects when a player has won the game or if the game ends in a draw.
Reset Game: Allows players to reset the game and start a new match.
Interactive UI: Engaging and easy-to-use user interface.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the game board and layout.
CSS3: For styling the game board, buttons, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6): For game logic, winner detection, and interactivity.

How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to click on the empty squares to place their mark (X or O).
The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all squares are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.
Click on the "Reset" button to start a new game.

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the game.
app.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

Future Improvements
Some ideas for future enhancements include:

Adding an AI opponent for single-player mode.
Including different difficulty levels.
Enhancing the UI with animations and sound effects.
Adding a score tracker to keep track of wins and draws.
